  - quote: I wish to highly recommend Judy Higdon Estate Sales to conduct your sale.  She conducted an estate sale for me recently and I was beyond impressed with her performance.  Ours was quite a large job and Judy handled it well.  She brought to the task a wealth of experience, knowledge, professionalism, and fairness.  Above all she has an ability to truly connect with the families for who she works, treating each persons’ treasures with respect, no matter how large or small.  I can’t say enough about how qualified and dependable Judy is for this job.

  - quote: Honestly, we don’t know what we would have done with YOU! Thank you for being a part of the end of someone’s life and even though she doesn’t know it, or comprehend all the work you did; one day, in heaven, she will. You have been a true blessing to our family and working with you has been a complete joy! If we lived there, I would be honored to have you as a friend. God bless you for all of your efforts and kindness towards us during this time of transition.
